<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Overall
Built for Hackclub Siege, this was a rather enormous undertaking for me. I thought I could just find some references, whip up some UI, and then be done for the day but... Scope creep caught up to me. Thank gosh Siege only allows for a week, otherwise this project would have been blown out of proportion. I will say that I have taken heavy inspiration from one person in particular, but this was also a testament to what I can do in Godot with my current skillset (and what I can do UI-wise). 

### What even is this?
A very simple UI-based game where the user explores, finds coins, and then unlocks the ending! Bonus points if they get all the blue coins! I will leave the question of how to get blue coins up to exploration since it's not difficult. Here's a nice feature list:
* 4 themed user interfaces to interact with
* Smooth transitions in between all menus
* Collectible gold and blue coins (3 of gold, and ? of blue)
* Nice sounds to go with the experience (see <a href="#acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</a> or 'ATTRIBUTIONS')
* Keyboard navigable user interface (currently doesn't work to pick up coins... that would be too easy!)
* A hidden ending that won't surprise you

### What do I take out of this?
Scope creep is definitely one. I came into this with big plans, and only got 4 sections done... The ending makes 5 but that doesn't really count. I did try making a mood board and a plan, but I found myself polishing features while the game wasn't finished yet. I think I should go with minimum viable product before going for polishing rounds, even if I feel like I have a time limit. 
Also, I learned a lot about how the Godot User Interface Nodes work: mouse_filter, containers, clip_contents, _gui_input(), etc. If we're talking strictly about Godot though, tweens are now my best friend. They do so much and are so nice (even though I don't do a good job of cleaning them up). 
Lastly, there was a moment when I woke up, opened up my code editor, and didn't comprehend what I had written at 12 am the night before. I gave myself the task of turning the code into a component, but it was so jank and slapped together that it took many hours to rewrite code that had taken barely an hour to initially put down. From now on, I will do my best to look ahead and compartmentalize things that will be used again, like the input system I made or the (lack of) a scene manager.

### Play 

If you'd like to build it yourself, I used Godot 4.4.1. I do have a pre-built web version available [here on my itch](https://pixelsaver.itch.io/just-u-and-i), but if you still insist on building this unoptimized mess, go ahead.

1. Install Godot 4.4
2. Download and unzip the code
3. Open the file with Godot project manager
4. Go to Project > Export, add whichever platform you're on (MacOS, Windows) and then click export.
5. You're good to go!
